## Five records of each variables:
1. Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
2. Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
3. A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
4. Its activity label. 
5. An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

## Steps:
- Firstly, create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
- Secondly,Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Then,Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement and uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- Finnaly, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
